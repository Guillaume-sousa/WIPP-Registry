06/01/2018

## INTRODUCTION

* This document describes a step by step installation process for installing NMRR 2.0 locally on a Windows operating system. 

* These instructions support the manual installation process for NMRR software version 2.0 (a.k.a., __nmrr__ located at https://github.com/usnistgov/nnmrr .

### Parameter Values

1. Readers of this document are expected to make appropriate adjustments where their system's parameters differ from those described in this process. 
2. Particularly for security-sensitive settings, such as usernames and passwords, readers are strongly encouraged:
	1. **DO** select parameter values which are secure and relevant to their installation.
	2. **DO NOT** use the example default parameter values provided here (which are insecure).
3. The default parameter values and examples used throughout this document are only provided for the purposes of illustrating the installation process steps as concretely as possible.

### Assumptions

* This installation process is being performed on a __Windows platform__.
	* If one is installing the NMRR on an operating system other than Windows, then
	  one must be sure to make the necessary modifications to each command or instruction.
		* e.g., such as using a different command terminal than the Windows platform command-line terminal.
	* With only small modifications, this process should also easily work on additional platforms where Python and Django are generally supported.
* The reader who is performing this installation process is familiar with basic tasks in that environment such as:
	* Updating environment variables (e.g., PATH).
	* Opening a command-line terminal (e.g., cmd.exe).
	* Following installation instructions for installing each application.
* The system on which this installation process is being performed has an __Internet connection__.
* Installation steps mostly involve typing or entering various commands at a command-line terminal (e.g., cmd.exe).
	* Some steps will require that additional tasks be performed (such as downloading and extracting files, executing installers, etc.).
	
### Conventions

* Certain steps described in these procedures should only take place within a __Python virtual environment__ in which the NMRR application is created. 
	* Commands that **should** happen in __only virtual-environment__ command-line terminal windows will be prefixed with **'$$'**.
	* All other commands that should NOT occur in a virtual-environment (but which often occur in the __system-level-environment__) command-line terminal window will be prefixed with **'$'**.
	
## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

###	1. Install supporting applications on your host system.

* Python 2.7: https://www.continuum.io/downloads (choose python 2)
* MongoDB   : https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community
* Redis     : https://redis.io/download
* Celery    : NOTE: This is installed below via `pip install`.

###	2. Configure the execution environment.
		
* Update the environment variable, __PATH__, to include the installation paths of each of the above-installed applications, respectively.

###	3. Open terminal window #1 and perform the first set of installation commands.
		
#### Open a terminal window.

```
$ cmd.exe
```
	
#### Install mkvirtualenv

* NOTE: This enables you to install the NMRR software in Python virtual environments.

* Command:
```
$ pip install virtualenvwrapper 
$ mkdir <install_path>\
$ cd <install_path>\
$ mkvirtualenv <nmrr_virtual_environment_name>	
```
* Example:
```
$ pip install virtualenvwrapper 
$ mkdir c:\nmrr-2.0\
$ cd c:\nmrr-2.0\
$ mkvirtualenv nmrr-2.0_env	
```

* NOTE: This __mkvirtualenv__ command:
	* Creates a new __Python virtual environment__: __nmrr-2.0_env__.
	* Automatically puts you into the virtual-environment after creating it.

#### Install the latest version of pip installation utility inside the newly-created virtual-environment.

```	
$$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### Download, extract, and configure nmrr from git repository.

* Download https://github.com/usnistgov/nnmrr/archive/master.zip to the <install_path>\ directory.
* Extract nmrr-master.zip to form the following base installation directory: <install_path>\nmrr-master\ .
* Then move into that base install directory.

```
$$ cd nmrr-master
```

#### Create configuration file directory for MongoDB.

```	
$$ mkdir conf
```

#### Create data directory for MongoDB.

```	
$$ mkdir data\db
```

#### Create <install_path>\nmrr-master\conf\mongodb.conf file with the following content:

* NOTE: This instruction asks the user to:
	1. Create a new file, mongodb.conf, in the <install_path>\nmrr-master\conf\ directory.
	2. Ensure that the given file has the following content.
	3. Save that file as the primary MongoDB configuration file.

* General File Contents:

```	
net: 
   bindIp: <ip_address>
security: 
   authorization: enabled
storage:
   dbPath: <install_path>/nmrr-master/data/db
```

* Example:

```	
net: 
   bindIp: 127.0.0.1
security: 
   authorization: enabled
storage:
   dbPath: c:/nmrr-2.0/nmrr-master/data/db
```
	
#### Install NMRR supporting and core software packages.

```	
$$ pip install -e git://github.com/MongoEngine/django-mongoengine.git@v0.2.1#egg=django-mongoengine
$$ pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
$$ pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.core.txt
```

#### Start MongoDB server.

```	
$$ mongod --config conf\mongodb.conf
```

###	4. Open terminal window #2 and perform the next set of installation commands.

#### Open terminal window.

```	
$ cmd.exe
```
	
#### Open virtual environment and move to the release installation directory.

* Command:
```	
$ workon <nmrr_virtual_environment_name>
$$ cd <install_path>\nmrr-master\
```
* Example:
```	
$ workon nmrr-2.0_env
$$ cd <install_path>\nmrr-master\
```

#### Create MongoDB administrative user.

* Command:

**NOTE:** Enter your own mongodb administrative username and password here. See the example below.

```	
$$ mongo --port 27017	
	
	use admin
	db.createUser(
	{
	user: "<mongodb_admin_username>",
	pwd: "<mongodb_admin_password>",
	roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin"},"backup","restore"]
	}
	)
	exit
```

* Example:

```	
$$ mongo --port 27017	
	
	use admin
	db.createUser(
	{
	user: "mdb_admin_user",
	pwd: "mdb_admin_pwd",
	roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin"},"backup","restore"]
	}
	)
	exit
```

* NOTES: 
	* From within MongoDB's shell, type (or copy/paste!) each line, hitting the <ENTER> key after each one.
	* When done entering these commands, the user will be logged out from MongoDB.	


#### Create MongoDB non-administrative user.

* Command:

	* Enter your own mongodb usernames and passwords for administrative and non-administrative accounts, respectively, here. Please see the example below.

```
$$ mongo --port 27017 -u "<mongodb_admin_username>" -p "<mongodb_admin_username>" --authenticationDatabase admin	
	use mgi
	db.createUser(
	{
	 user: "<mongodb_nonadmin_username>",
	 pwd: "<mongodb_nonadmin_password>",
	 roles: ["readWrite"]
	}
	)
	exit
```


* Example:

```
$$ mongo --port 27017 -u "mdb_admin_user" -p "mdb_admin_pwd" --authenticationDatabase admin	
	use mgi
	db.createUser(
	{
	 user: "mdb_user",
	 pwd: "mdb_pwd",
	 roles: ["readWrite"]
	}
	)
	exit
```

* NOTES: 
	* From within MongoDB's shell, type (or copy/paste!) each line, hitting the <ENTER> key after each one.
	* When done entering these commands, the user will be logged out from MongoDB.	

#### Edit and save <install_path>\nmrr-master\nmrr\settings.py file.

* Original settings.py settings:
```			
		MONGO_USER     = "mgi_user"
		MONGO_PASSWORD = "mgi_password"
```

* Change to:	

	* Command:
		* Enter your own mongodb non-administrative username and password here. See the example below.
			* Edit <install_path>\nmrr-master\nmrr\settings.py
			* Change MONGO_USER and MONGO_PASSWORD settings to your own mongodb non-administrative username and password.	
				
	```			
			MONGO_USER     = "<mongodb_nonadmin_username>"
			MONGO_PASSWORD = "<mongodb_nonadmin_password>"
	```

	* Example:

	```				
			MONGO_USER     = "mdb_user"
			MONGO_PASSWORD = "mdb_pwd"
	```

#### Start Redis server.

* Command:
```
$$ redis-server <redis_configuratiaon_filename>
```

* Example:
```
$$ redis-server "c:\Program Files\Redis\redis.windows.conf"
```

* NOTES: 
	* When redis-server starts, it will create a background process and will return to the command terminal prompt, allowing one to reuse that terminal to run other commands

#### **(ON WINDOWS ONLY)** Remove incompatibility with celery 4.x.

```
$$ pip uninstall celery
```

_Proceed (y/n)? y_

```
$$ pip install celery==3.1.18	
```

* NOTES:
	* In some cases, it appears that Celery 4.x is incompatible with Windows. Thus, Windows users are asked to downgrade their Celery to an earlier version in order for it to work on Windows.
	* However, non-Windows users should be able to skip this step and use Celery 4.x as is.
	
#### Start celery.

```
$$ celery -A nmrr worker -l info -Ofair --purge
```

###	5. Open terminal window #3 and perform the last set of installation commands.

```
$ cd <install_path>\nmrr-master\
$ workon nmrr-2.0_env
$$ python manage.py migrate auth
$$ python manage.py migrate
$$ python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
$$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```
* Command:
	* When prompted, fill in the following info: 
		* username      : <nmrr_superuser_username>
		* email         : <nmrr_superuser_email>
		* password (x2) : <nmrr_superuser_password>

* Example:
	* When prompted, fill in the following info: 
		* username      : mgi_superuser
		* email         : user_email@institution.com
		* password (x2) : mgi_superuser_pwd

#### Run the system.

* Command:		
```
$$ python manage.py runserver <ip_address>:<port_number>
```

* Example:		
```
$$ python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000
```

###	6. Open system URL in a browser.

* Command:
	* open: http://<ip_address>:<port_number>
	
* Example:
	* open: http://127.0.0.1:8000
	
###	7. Login with superuser credentials. 			   

* NOTE: The default from the top is username=mgi, password=mgi.

## Appendix A: Starting up a fully-installed system from a shutdown state

### Ensure MongoDB, Redis, and Celery are running in command-line windows.
	
#### in terminal window #1

```	
$$ mongod --config conf\mongodb.conf
```	

#### in terminal window #2

```	
$$ redis-server "c:\Program Files\Redis\redis.windows.conf"				
```

* NOTES: 
	* The above is the syntax for a Window's Redis install. This may be different on other operating systems.
	* When redis-server starts, it will create a background process and will return to the command terminal prompt, allowing one to reuse that terminal to run other commands

```	
$$ celery -A nmrr worker -l info -Ofair --purge			
```
	
#### in terminal window #3

#### Run the system.

* Command:		
```
$$ python manage.py runserver <ip_address>:<port_number>
```

* Example:		
```
$$ python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000
```

### Open browser: http://<ip_address>:<port_number>

* Command:
	* open: http://<ip_address>:<port_number>
	
* Example:
	* open: http://127.0.0.1:8000

### Login with superuser credentials. 			

* Command: login with:
	* username: <nmrr_superuser_username>
	* password: <nmrr_superuser_password>

* Example: login with:
	* username: mgi_superuser
	* password: mgi_superuser_pwd
